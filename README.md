## A terminal based chat TUI with E2EE and multi-layer asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC, AES)

Most developers, or people who are interested with the inner workings of computers, spend a lot of their time inside the terminal. So, what if you could speak to other users without having to leave the terminal? What if those messages are E2EE too?

Beatrice is the name of my Wife and I's Jack Russell puppy, she's wonderful. For a puppy, she's very quiet, and when I'm singing to her, or ranting about my day at work, she just looks up at me and then immediately gets back to chewing my hoodie or the desk or my shoes... 

I wondered if she was listening, or just waiting until her next meal, or walkies. She's probably thinking, what on earth are you talking about? And that's the bit that got me. Encryption dog. 

I speak to her, but she's got no idea what I'm saying. 

**This chat happens entirely within your terminal emulator, and has absolutely no idea what you are talking about.** 

It features multi-layer asymmetric encryption - RSA, ECC and AES.
You can add friends/contacts.
You can integrate it with terminal multiplexers, keeping you within the terminal and focussed. 
You can send files to your contacts.
You can integrate with GitHub.
