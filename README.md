# Beatrice 🐶
> A terminal-based TUI chat app that has absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

For developers, sysadmins, or anyone who lives in the terminal: why leave your workflow just to talk to your team? Beatrice keeps your communication right where you work.

And, thanks to its custom end-to-end encryption implementation, Beatrice has *absolutely no idea* what you're talking about.

## Project Status: Prototype

It's primary goal was to help me learn core concepts in **Network Security**, **Asynchronous I/O**, and **Cryptography**.

**Current Features:**
* **Modern TUI:** Built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) for a smooth, mouse-compatible terminal experience.
* **Asynchronous:** Fully non-blocking architecture using Python's `asyncio`.
* **Hybrid Encryption:** Secures messages using **RSA-2048** for key exchange and **AES-GCM** for message confidentiality and integrity.
* **Real-time Messaging:** Instant messaging with live online user tracking.

## Security Model & Limitations

### The Architecture
1.  **RSA Handshake:** Upon connection, clients exchange public keys with the server.
2.  **AES Session:** Messages are encrypted using AES-GCM, ensuring both privacy and integrity.
3.  **Simple Server Setup:** The server routes encrypted packets but cannot decrypt the content (assuming no active MITM).

### Project Roadmap
This project is under active development. The following features are next on the agenda:

* [ ] **Data Persistence:** Currently, chat history is ephemeral and clears when the server restarts. A database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) implementation is planned to store encrypted message blobs.

* [ ] **Online User List:** This currently has a static 🟢 when other users are connected. I have plans to implement user status, which will set users to 🟠 if they are inactive for a certain period of time. Would need to have packets sent from the server, and then you could do a mouse or trigger event from the textual client that sends a packet back to the server if a user is still active... or something like that.

* [ ] **Make The UI Great (Again):** I'm not much of a designer. If the backend works and the UI can serve the backend, then I'm happy. I am aware it's super basic at the moment.

* [ ] **Add Vim Keymaps:** I use nvim btw.

* [ ] **Optimisation:** Some of the iterations through sending packets to connected users run in O(n). I would want to explore ways to speed this up.

## How to Run

This project requires **Python 3.10+**.

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies (Textual and Cryptography).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derkajecht/beatrice.git
cd beatrice
pip install textual cryptography
```

### To start the server - do this first!
```bash
python server.py
```

### To start the main app, open a new terminal window and run the following;
```bash
python beatrice.py
```
*Enter a nickname when prompted. You can open multiple beatrice.py client windows to test messaging between them. :)*

## 🐶 The Story: What's an "Encryption Dog"?

Beatrice is the name of my wife's and my Jack Russell puppy. She's wonderful.

For a puppy, she's very quiet. When I'm singing to her, or ranting about my day at work, she just looks up at me and then immediately gets back to chewing my hoodie, the desk, or my shoes...

I often wonder if she's listening, or just waiting until her next meal. She's probably thinking, "What on earth are you talking about?"

And that's the bit that got me. Encryption dog.

I speak to her, but she's got no idea what I'm saying. This chat app is the same. It happens entirely within your terminal, and it has absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
